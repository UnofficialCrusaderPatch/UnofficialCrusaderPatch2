# Unofficial Crusader Patch  [![UCP_Official](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/426318193603117057/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/vmy7CBR)


 ## Project

This project is an unofficial patcher for [Firefly Studio's](https://fireflyworlds.com/) game Stronghold Crusader 1. It features bug-fixes, balancing and quality-of-life changes, as well as several AIV castles. To apply this patch you need to have Stronghold Crusader installed, the setup does not include any files created by FireFly Studios, but instead edits them or adds community-made files. Further information can be found on our official [website](https://sh0wdown.github.io/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/).

## Installation

To install the patch you just have to download the [latest UnofficialCrusaderPatch.exe release](https://github.com/Sh0wdown/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/releases), execute it and choose the correct path of your Stronghold Crusader installation. You can then select several features you wish to install, recommended presettings are selected by default. The patch should work for most crusader versions, but only v1.41 and v1.41E are officially supported. If you encounter an error using a different version, you can upgrade to 1.41 for free using Firefly’s [Crusader HD Patch](http://www.strongholdcrusaderhd.com/patch.html).

## Issues and Suggestions

If you have suggestions, you are welcome to post new ideas or discuss already existing ones in the [issues section](https://github.com/Sh0wdown/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/issues). It would be great if you could follow these guidelines:

- try to only post one idea per issue to help us keep an overview
- try to check if your suggestion already has a topic and join that discussion instead of creating a new one
- keep the tone nice and civil  

Furthermore you can join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/vmy7CBR) for quick help and feedback.
