    <system:String x:Key="ai_access">No demolishing of inaccessible buildings</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_access_descr">
        Prevents the AI from demolishing buildings without access. This should 
        stop the AI from continuously demolishing and rebuilding buildings where no 
        access is available.
    </system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_defense">Fix reinforcement of defense troops</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_defense_descr">
        Fixes a bug which stopped the AI from reinforcing missing troops 
        on walls and towers, as long as defensive patrols were still around. 
        Moreover, the probability for AIs to recruit defensive troops was generally 
        increased, as this value was vor some AIs zero.
    </system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_tethers">Disable ox tether spam</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_tethers_descr">
        Usually, the AI builds for each new stone quarry a new ox tether, 
        independent of how many tether already exist. This can be disabled here, since 
        it leads to ox tether spam if the AIs' quarries get destroyed repeatedly.
    </system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_buywood">Buy enough wood</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_buywood_descr">
        To prevent thievish fletchers from stealing wood which the AI just bought for
        buildings, 2 extra wood will now be bought for each building.
    </system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_towerengines">"No limit for siege engines on towers</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_towerengines_descr">
        Usually the AI only builds up to three mangonels and ballistae each on its towers. 
        This limit can be lifted here.
    </system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_assaultswitch">No AI target change during sieges</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_assaultswitch_descr">
        AI lords which attack the mightiest oder weakest enemy sometimes 
        switch their target in the middle of an ongoing assault and send their 
        troops to a different castle. This is prevented with this setting, as soon 
        as the assault has started, i.e. during the troop gathering phase in front of 
        a castle a change can still happen.
    </system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_rebuild">Improved AI repairs</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_rebuild_descr">
        The AI will repair tower ruins, slightly damaged walls, as well as 
        destroyed engineer's and tunneler's guilds and oil smelters, of which the gathering place 
        still exists. Furthermore, the AI can now build over the collection platform 
        of quarries.

    <!-- AI lords -->
    <system:String x:Key="ai_attacklimit">Increase of the attacking troops limit of the AIs</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_attacklimit_descr">
        The number of additional units which are added after the first attack is
        limited to 200 in Vanilla. Here you can change this limit.
    </system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_attackwave">Improve attack waves</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_attackwave_descr">
        The AI in an attack in vanilla only sends as many troops at once as 
        there are wall parts reachable. This causes units to drop in in small waves 
        when the target castle has a lot of buildings directly at its walls.
        This option makes units also attack civil and fortification buildings, as 
        well as wall parts which are already being attacked by one unit. Moreover,
        the AI sends more troops to the enemy lord as soon as it detects a breach.

    <system:String x:Key="ai_attacktarget_weakest">Weakest Enemy</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_attacktarget_weakest_descr">
        With this setting, all AI lords will chose their next attack target in 
        the same way. This prevents troops switching targets during a castle assault 
        as well as sending them past other enemies' castles to gather.
    </system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_nosleep">Disable sleeping mode for lack of resources</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_nosleep_descr">
        The AI usually puts its processing buildings to sleep, as soon 
        as the needed resource is missing. This is done without the regard for 
        losing products which are just on the way f.e. to the weapon chamber.
        This feature can be completely disabled here.

    <system:String x:Key="ai_demolish_eco_descr">
        If the AI feels pressured, it likes to demolishes its economy or 
        fortification buildings to get quick money for troops. This feature sometimes 
        seems to be triggered without any visible reason and thus can be disabled here.
    </system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_addattack">Increase of the rate of additional attack troops</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_addattack_descr">
        In Vanilla the attack troop number is increased after each attack by 5 
        units on average. This value is the same for all AI lords and can be changed 
        here.
    </system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="ai_addattack_alt_descr" xml:space="preserve">Alternatively, the additional troop count can be made dependent on the troop count of the first attack. Since this value is different for each AI, the following attacks will also scale, instead of increasing by the same value  for each AI lord.
Example: Scale factor = 0.5
Sultan's attack troops = 10, 15, 20, 25, ...
Saladin's attack troops = 50, 75, 100, 125, ...</system:String>

    <system:String x:Key="u_ArabWall_descr">
        In Vanilla, arabic swordsmen destroy walls slower than any other melee unit. 
        With this option, the tear down speed against walls is about doubled for them, 
        putting them slightly above Spearmen.
    </system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="u_spearmen">Increased armor of spearmen against ranged units</system:String>

        The healer of the apothecary building now actively seeks out injured soldiers, 
        civilists and animals to heal them. The nearest targets are treated first. With each 
        healing animation ca. 1/3 of a spearman's health is recovered. The strolling through 
        gardens and investigation of plague clouds is not replaced! Only the strolling through 
        the castle is skipped until no more wounded targets are in the area.

    <system:String x:Key="o_engineertent_descr">
        With this setting, the game will not deselect your chosen siege equipment
