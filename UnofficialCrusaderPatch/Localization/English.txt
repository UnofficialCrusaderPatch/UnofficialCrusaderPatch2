"This is an unofficial patch for Stronghold Crusader.
The project ist available as open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sh0wdown/UnofficialCrusaderPatch).

Any Crusader version is potentially supported, but since the changes were derived from the 1.41 Steam-Version, incompatibilities may appear.
The setup will then show error messages. The installed patch version is shown in the bottom left corner of the main menu of the game. 
Before any changes, backup files will be created. These can be restored via the 'Uninstall'-button or manually.
