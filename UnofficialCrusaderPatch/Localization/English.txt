"This is an unofficial patch for Stronghold Crusader.
The project ist available as open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sh0wdown/UnofficialCrusaderPatch).

Any Crusader version is potentially supported, but since the changes where &
derived with the 1.41 Steam-Version, incompatibilities may appear. The setup &
will then show error messages. The installed patch version is shown in the &
bottom left corner of the main menu. Before any changes, backup files will &
be created. These can be restored via the 'Uninstall'-button or manually.

At this point I would like to thank the Stronghold community for supporting &
me so enthusiastically.

Special thanks go to:
[FireFly Studios](https://fireflyworlds.com/) for the creation of the Stronghold series
[Udwin (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/user/UdwinLP), because he made me remember Stronghold
[Lutel (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrLutel05) for the polish translation
[Lolasik011](https://github.com/Lolasik011) for the russian translation
[Evrey](https://github.com/Evrey) for his AI castles
